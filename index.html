My work blends technical expertise with the creative spark I get from my love of music, movies, and gaming - influences that push me to craft digital experiences that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and fun to use.</p>
    <p>Whether you're looking for a clean, modern web design or need help building a full-stack application, I'm excited to bring your ideas to life.</p>
